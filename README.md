# ECG-6-Derivations-System
This repository contains a complete bioinstrumentation solution for capturing, filtering, and visualizing Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The project integrates custom hardware acquisition with a high-performance software interface. It calculates the 6 frontal leads (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, and aVF) in real-time based on Einthoven’s Law.
